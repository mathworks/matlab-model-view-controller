This repository contains the MATLAB® code for the technical article [Developing MATLAB Apps Using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern](https://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/developing-matlab-apps-using-the-model-view-controller-pattern.html). The article provides a step-by-step guide for building a small MVC application. You can inspect the source code and modify it to suit your own application needs.

Developing an application using MVC can help address the following common development concerns when creating large-scale applications:
<ul>
<li>Best practices and guidelines for structuring the code base to allow future growth.</li>
<li>Using a combination of functional and object-oriented programming.</li>
<li>Working effectively with MATLAB® graphics and user-interface control objects.</li>
<li>Enabling collaboration within a team by separating the application into components, which are developed and tested simultaneously.</li>
</ul>

To learn more about developing applications using MATLAB®, check out the training courses [Building Interactive Applications in MATLAB®](https://www.mathworks.com/learn/training/building-interactive-applications-in-matlab.html) and [Advanced MATLAB® Application Development](https://www.mathworks.com/learn/training/advanced-matlab-application-development.html).

## Installation and Getting Started
1. Clone or fork the repository to get started. You may also download the repository content as .zip.
2. Open the project by double-clicking on `MVC.prj`.
2. Run the application using `launchMVCApp.m` in the `code` folder.
